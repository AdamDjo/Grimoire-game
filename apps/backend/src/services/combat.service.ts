 * - **the creature must belong on this floor** — `creaturesForDepth` is the
 *   canon anti-rule "jamais un légendaire aux étages 1-2, même pour la

 * - **a dying character is never ambushed into a fight** — canon grants one

 *   would spend that reprieve on a death the player could not act against.
